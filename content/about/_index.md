DebConf is the annual conference for Debian contributors and users interested
in improving Debian. Previous Debian conferences have featured speakers and
attendees from all around the world.  DebConf17 was held in August 2017 in
Montreal, Canada and was attended by 400 participants from 50 countries.

DebConf18 will be located in Hsinchu, Taiwan, and is the first DebConf in Asia.
It will be held from from July 29 to August 5, preceded by DebCamp, July 21 to
July 27, and Open Day, July 28.

The Venue
---------

National Chiao Tung University is situated near Hsinchu Science and Industrial
Park,  often called Asia's "Silicon Valley".  Hsinchu is one of the world's
most significant centers for computer hardware development and manufacturing.
The university is providing us a variety of comfortable environments for
plenary discussions, presentations, and informal workgroup meetings.
Participant accommodations are also available on campus.

About Debian
------------

The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause
to create the completely free operating system. This operating system that we
have created is called Debian.

An operating system (OS) is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel
is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic
housekeeping and lets you start other programs.

Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a
piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of
programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and
other software.

Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (pre-compiled software that is bundled
up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager
(APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of
packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single
application. All of it free.

A Safe Environment for All
--------------------------

DebConf is committed to a safe environment for all participants. All attendees
are expected to treat all people and facilities with respect and help create a
welcoming and collaborative atmosphere. If anyone notices behaviour that fails
to meet this standard, they are encouraged to speak up and help keep DebConf as
respectful as we expect it to be.

If someone is harassed and requests to stop are not successful, or if they
notice a disrespectful environment for others, the organizers want to help.
Please contact us at <antiharassment@debian.org>. We will treat all requests
with dignity and confidentiality, investigate, and take whatever actions are
appropriate. We can provide information on security, emergency services,
transportation, alternative accommodations, or whatever else may be necessary.
If mediation is not successful, DebConf reserves the right to to take action
against those who do not cease unacceptable behavior.
