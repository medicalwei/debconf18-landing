# Call for Participation

The DebConf Content team would like to call for participation in the DebConf18
conference, to be held in Hsinchu, Taiwan, from July 29. to August 5., 2018.

You can find this Call for Proposals, in its latest form,
[online](https://debconf18.debconf.org/cfp/).

Please refer to this URL for updates on the present information.


## Suggesting a Speaker

The content team has a (limited) number of spots for invited speakers and is
open to suggestions. Priority will be given to speakers who are not regular
DebConf attendees, and who are more likely to bring diverse viewpoints to the
conference.

Please keep in mind that some speakers may have very busy schedules and need to
be booked far in advance. Therefore, we would like to start inviting speakers as
soon as possible.

In order to suggest a speaker, please email <content@debconf.org>; your email
should provide the following information:

- The speaker's preferred name
- Their location (for travel budget considerations)
- Their affiliation (institution and/or project)
- The suggested talk topic
- Brief biography (50-100 words) as it relates to the suggested topic
- The topic's relevance to Debian and/or DebConf

Note that the [Code of Conduct] applies to invited speakers and their talks, and
coming to DebConf (incl. accepting an invitation) requires them to accept it.


## Submitting an Event

Once the conference system is online, submit an [event proposal] and describe
your plan. Please note, events are not limited to traditional presentations or
informal sessions (BoFs). We welcome submissions of tutorials, performances, art
installations, debates, or any other format of event that you think would be of
interest to the Debian community.

Regular sessions may either be 20 or 45 minutes long (including time for
questions), other kinds of sessions (workshops, demos, lightning talks, ...)
could have different durations. Please choose the most suitable duration for
your event and explain any special requests.

You will need to create an account on the site, to submit a talk. We suggest
that Debian account holders (including DDs and DMs) to use [Debian SSO] when
creating an account. However, this isn’t required, as you can sign up with an
e-mail address and password.

## Timeline

If you depend on having your proposal accepted in order to attend the
conference, please submit it as soon as possible so that it can be considered
(and potentially accepted) as soon as possible.

All proposals must be submitted before Sunday 17 June 2017 to be evaluated for
the official schedule.


## Topics and Tracks

Though we invite proposals on any Debian or FLOSS related subject, we have some
broad topics on which we encourage people to submit proposals, including:

- Blends
- Cloud and containers
- Debian in Science
- Embedded
- Packaging, policy and infrastructure
- Security
- Social context
- Systems administration, automation and orchestration

You are welcome to either suggest more tracks, or to become a coordinator for
any of them; please refer to the [Content Tracks] wiki page for more information
on that.

## Code of Conduct

Our event is covered by a [Code of Conduct] designed to ensure everyone’s safety
and comfort. The code applies to all attendees, including speakers and the
content of their presentations. Do not hesitate to contact us at
<content@debconf.org> if you have any questions or are unsure about certain
content you’d like to present.

[Code of Conduct]: https://debconf.org/codeofconduct.shtml


## Video Coverage

Providing video of sessions amplifies DebConf achievements and is one of the
[conference goals]. Unless speakers opt-out, scheduled talks will be streamed
live over the Internet to promote remote participation, and recordings will be
published later under the [DebConf license] (MIT/Expat), as well as presentation
slides and papers whenever available.

In case of any questions, or if you wanted to bounce some ideas off us first,
